# NumberGuessingGame
[project Inspiration](https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game)


A simple number guessing game, initially build to just mess around and find out
but eventually one thing lead to another and long story short here we are.

# Requirements
> the project did had some requirements and are listed below.

- When the game starts, it should display a welcome message 
along with the rules of the game.

- The computer should randomly select a number between 1 and 100.

- User should select the difficulty level (easy, medium, hard)
which will determine the number of chances they get to guess the number.

- The user should be able to enter their guess.

- If the user’s guess is correct, the game should display a 
congratulatory message along with the number of attempts 
it took to guess the number.

- If the user’s guess is incorrect, the game should display a message 
indicating whether the number is greater or less than the user’s guess.

- The game should end when the user guesses the correct number or runs out of chances.
